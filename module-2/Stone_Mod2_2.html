<h1>Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
<h2>My Info</h2>

    <p><span class="intro">My name is Colton Stone, and I currently live in Virginia.
    I am a college student who is studying to earn my bachelor’s degree in computer science.
    After earning my degree, I plan to start a career in the Software Development field.</span>
    </p>


<p>Even though I live in Virginia I currently work in a factory located in North Carolina which is only a short distance from my apartment.
    Prior to this I worked in a food production plant located in Rocky Mount, VA for nearly two years.
    Thus far every job that I have ever done has been in a factory/warehouse type setting.</p>

<p>As a student my studying and homework does take up much of my week,
    however my new job only requires me to work thirty-six hours per week which has made it easier on my schedule.
    When not working I like to spend my free time playing video games or listening to audiobooks.
    I also will often watch YouTube or read comic books especially during my break times at work.</p>

<p>Occasionally when I have extra time during a week,
    I will try to make time for practicing drawing or writing as well since I do have interest in pursing careers in those areas.
    <span class="sentence">My favorite activity overall is easily listening to music,
    there is rarely a moment in my life particularly when I am driving or studying where I will not have a playlist playing in the background.</span>
    Outside of these hobbies I do consider myself a fitness enthusiast who tries to make time to exercise and lift weights at least twice a week.</p>
